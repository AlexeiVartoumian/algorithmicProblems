ok i think this is a dead end.
I tried to approach it like this for the following reason. I have a playbook with many roles that are playbooks onto themselves. the hope was that I could use lambda and lambda layers in conjunction with step functions to replicate how ansible would execute the playbook. this needed to be so because then I can use terraform to declare these resources as part of an integrated pipeline where this playbook is part of. whats important here Is im trying to "lift and shift" these playbooks as part of a pipeline . in this stage where this playbook would be executed , step functions would orchestrate what should be executed and when. if lambda is out because of multi-processing what other options do i have that fit these requirements ?


Thank you for providing this context. It's clear that you're looking for a way to integrate your existing Ansible playbooks into a more cloud-native, infrastructure-as-code approach using AWS services and Terraform. Given that Lambda isn't suitable due to the multiprocessing limitations, let's explore some alternative approaches that could meet your requirements:

AWS Step Functions with ECS Tasks:
Instead of Lambda, use ECS (Elastic Container Service) tasks to run your Ansible playbooks.
Each step in your Step Functions workflow could invoke an ECS task.
Benefits:
No multiprocessing limitations
Can be defined and managed with Terraform
Allows for larger execution environments than Lambda
Implementation:
Create a Docker image with Ansible and your playbooks
Define ECS task definitions for each major step or role in your playbook
Use Step Functions to orchestrate the execution of these ECS tasks
AWS Step Functions with EC2 instances:
Similar to the ECS approach, but using EC2 instances instead.
Use Systems Manager (SSM) Run Command to execute Ansible on the EC2 instances.
Benefits:
Full control over the execution environment
Can use existing EC2-based Ansible setups
Implementation:
Create an AMI with Ansible pre-installed
Use Step Functions to start EC2 instances and trigger SSM Run Command
Terraform can manage the EC2 instances, Step Functions, and SSM documents
AWS Batch with Step Functions:
AWS Batch is designed for running batch computing workloads.
Benefits:
Scalable and cost-effective for larger workloads
Can be managed with Terraform
Implementation:
Create a container image with Ansible
Define AWS Batch job definitions for your playbooks
Use Step Functions to submit and manage Batch jobs
Custom Orchestrator on EC2:
Run a custom orchestration service on an EC2 instance that can execute Ansible playbooks.
Use Step Functions to send commands to this orchestrator.
Benefits:
Full control over execution
Can closely mimic existing Ansible workflows
Implementation:
Develop a simple API that can receive commands from Step Functions
This API triggers Ansible playbooks on the EC2 instance
Terraform manages the EC2 instance, Step Functions, and related resources
AWS CodeBuild with Step Functions:
Use CodeBuild projects to run Ansible playbooks.
Benefits:
Managed service with good Terraform support
No need to manage containers or instances directly
Implementation:
Create CodeBuild projects for each major step in your playbook
Use Step Functions to trigger and manage CodeBuild projects
Store Ansible playbooks in CodeCommit or S3
For all these options, you would use Step Functions to orchestrate the overall flow, replicating the structure of your Ansible playbook. Terraform would be used to declare and manage all the AWS resources involved.

Recommendation:
Given your requirements, I would suggest starting with option 1 (ECS Tasks with Step Functions) or option 5 (CodeBuild with Step Functions). These options provide a good balance of flexibility, scalability, and ease of management with Terraform.

Here's a high-level approach to implement option 1:

Containerize your Ansible environment:
Create a Dockerfile that includes Ansible and your playbooks
Push this image to Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)
Use Terraform to set up:
ECS Cluster
Task Definitions for each major role or step in your playbook
Step Functions state machine that orchestrates the ECS tasks
IAM roles and policies
Structure your Step Functions workflow to mirror your playbook's flow, with each state corresponding to an ECS task that runs a specific part of your Ansible playbook.
This approach allows you to "lift and shift" your playbooks into a cloud-native architecture while maintaining the workflow and structure you're familiar with from Ansible.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these options or provide a more detailed plan for implementation?

i like option 2


Excellent choice. Option 2, using AWS Step Functions with EC2 instances, provides a good balance of control and integration with AWS services. Let's dive into how we can implement this approach to replicate your Ansible playbook execution using Step Functions, EC2 instances, and SSM Run Command. We'll also discuss how to manage this with Terraform.

Here's a detailed plan:

Create an AMI with Ansible pre-installed:
Start with an Amazon Linux 2 AMI
Install Ansible and any other required dependencies
Store your playbooks and roles in a specific directory (e.g., /opt/ansible)
Set up EC2 infrastructure:
Create a VPC with appropriate subnets
Set up security groups
Create an IAM role for the EC2 instances with necessary permissions
Create SSM documents:
For each major role or step in your playbook, create an SSM document
These documents will contain the commands to run specific parts of your Ansible playbook
Set up Step Functions:
Create a state machine that orchestrates the execution of your playbook
Each state in the machine will correspond to a step in your playbook
Use Terraform to manage all of these resources
Here's a more detailed breakdown of each step:

AMI Creation: You can use Packer to create this AMI. Here's a sample Packer template:

    }
  }
}
EOF
}
This setup allows you to:

Start an EC2 instance from your custom AMI
Run each role or major step of your playbook as a separate state in the Step Functions workflow
Use SSM Run Command to execute Ansible on the EC2 instance
Terminate the EC2 instance when the playbook execution is complete
To integrate this with your pipeline:

Use Terraform to set up all these resources as part of your infrastructure
Trigger the Step Functions execution as a step in your pipeline
This approach gives you the flexibility of Ansible while leveraging AWS services for orchestration and management. It also allows you to easily integrate with other AWS services and manage everything as code with Terraform.

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this implementation or discuss how to further customize it for your specific playbook structure?
