AFT_ACCOUNT_ID          
AFT_VAULT_NAME        
MGMT_VAULT_NAME       

The flow works like this:

In AFT Account:

Backup event occurs
EventBridge rule catches the event
Forwards event to management account's default event bus


In Management Account:

Event arrives on default event bus
EventBridge rule catches the event
Triggers the Lambda function
Lambda checks/creates vault and copies backup
