Just some buggy algorithms for Computer Organisation AKA operating systems upcoming exam.
they work but are brutally buggy and are just for fun 

bankersAlgorithm -> assigning resources in a concurrent OS to processes
pagingQuestions -> each process has a virtual mem Pagetable where each entry is a pointer to main memory address spaces, make things fast with a cache on those pages and replacement policies of FIFO , LRU and OPTIMAL which is impossible 

DiskALgo -> reading track requests in on a disk  as FIFO , SCAN which is up then down and CSCAN which is only ever up modulo number of tracks

ROUNDRObin -> a style of concurrency/ time-sharing where each process enjoys a fixed amount of time (Quantum) in a round robin fashion
