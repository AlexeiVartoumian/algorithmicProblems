bcrypt
well established secure -> uses salting for preventing rainbow table attacjs
efficient enough for most apps

argon2
winnofr of hasing competinsin
three variants argon2 , argon2i , argon2id -> recommended as most secure 
highly efficient 




pbkdf2 -> password based key derivation function2
nist apporved key derivation function
can be slower to brcypt and arong2

cookies -> 
key value pairs used for session management personalicaion and tracking user beahviour

usage in a server client architecture 
when server wants to set a cookie sends in http response
browser sends to the same domain
tupical info they carry -> session id to id user session , user preferencess such as language thenee settugbs 
and tracking info for analytics  i.e server stores session id in a cookie and on each req server will know about session based on this cookie

session is server side staorage of user data to persist across multiple requirest
session data is linked to uniq session id and stored in a cooie on client side
sessions used to store user specific data 
for storing session id can use redis -> in memory db or mongodb for in mem-db

json jswt use jwt for stateless sessions
rest principles dictate that api should be stateless and in this case use jwt 
compact url safe token format for securlet transmitting
consits of three parts header payload and signate
they carry info and calims

1. server generates a jwt conaitning use r info signs and and send to clinet in repsonse body or cookie
2. client stores the jwt to server cline includes authorization header using braer schema
