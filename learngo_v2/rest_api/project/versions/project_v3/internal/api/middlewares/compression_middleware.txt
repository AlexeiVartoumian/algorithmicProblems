compression reduces size of response body decreasing loading times
- advantageous for apps with high trafiic or big payloads


when it might not be needed 
- small payloads
- already compressed assets
- cpu overhead 
consider usecase i.e rednering web pages iamges graphix  then good use case 
but if a static website then samll gain
