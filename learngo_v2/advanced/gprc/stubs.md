a stub is a pieve of code used to stand in for other programming functionality 
a temporary replacement used to simualte the behaviour of complex mpoduels

stubs in rpc context
- intemediary between a client and seerver 
- client side stub translates the clients procdeure calls into netwoerk messages taht can be sent ot server

a stub then serves as a proxy handling the details of network communication allowing the client to call 
procedures as if they were local functions

therefore there client side stubs and server-side stubs

-client side stub is the code that represents the remote procedure and provides the same interface 
as the actual procedure but handles the communication with the server
