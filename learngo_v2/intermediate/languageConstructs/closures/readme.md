whats a cloasure a funciton value that references varaibles outside its body

in go functions are first class citizens meaning 

can be assigned to variables apassed as arguments .
closures can capture state. 

encapsualte data, state and behaviour-> used in callback functions to provide context/state for asynchronus operations
closures are memory hungry -> holding references to large objects be expensive i.e slice map
