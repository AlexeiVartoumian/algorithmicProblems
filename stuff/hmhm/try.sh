Perfect! Let's create a step by step plan to audit what EKS (and other) actions your specific EC2 instance is actually using:

First, verify the instance and role connection:

bashCopy# Get the role name from instance profile
aws ec2 describe-instances \
    --instance-id YOUR-INSTANCE-ID \
    --query 'Reservations[].Instances[].IamInstanceProfile.Arn' \
    --output text

Then get the actual API calls being made by your instance:

bashCopy# Look for events from your specific instance
aws cloudtrail lookup-events \
    --start-time "2024-02-13" \
    --lookup-attributes AttributeKey=Username,AttributeValue=YOUR-INSTANCE-ID \
    | jq '.Events[] | {
        eventName: (.CloudTrailEvent | fromjson).eventName,
        eventSource: (.CloudTrailEvent | fromjson).eventSource
    }'

To focus specifically on EKS actions:

bashCopy# Filter for just EKS service actions
aws cloudtrail lookup-events \
    --start-time "2024-02-13" \
    --lookup-attributes AttributeKey=Username,AttributeValue=YOUR-INSTANCE-ID \
    | jq '.Events[] | select((.CloudTrailEvent | fromjson).eventSource == "eks.amazonaws.com") | {
        eventName: (.CloudTrailEvent | fromjson).eventName,
        eventTime: (.CloudTrailEvent | fromjson).eventTime
    }'
This will show you:

Every EKS API call made
When it was made
The exact action name (which maps directly to IAM permissions)

For example, if you see:
jsonCopy{
    "eventName": "DescribeCluster",
    "eventTime": "2024-03-13T10:00:00Z"
}
This means you need eks:DescribeCluster permission (not eks:*).
Would you like me to help you run these commands and analyze the output for your specific instance?








Yes! Here are a few more useful approaches knowing your instance and role:

Check IAM Access Analyzer (this is really useful):

bashCopy# Start a policy generation based on actual usage
aws accessanalyzer start-policy-generation \
    --policy-generation-details '{
        "PrincipalArn": "arn:aws:iam::YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID:role/YOUR-ROLE-NAME"
    }'

Use CloudWatch Logs Insights if you have CloudTrail logs there:

Copyfields @timestamp, eventName, eventSource, userIdentity.principalId
| filter userIdentity.principalId like 'YOUR-INSTANCE-ID'
| stats count(*) by eventName, eventSource
| sort count(*) desc

Check what applications/processes are running on the instance that might be making AWS calls:

bashCopy# SSH to instance and check processes
ps aux | grep aws
ps aux | grep boto
ls -la /root/.aws/  # Check for AWS config files
ls -la /home/*/.aws/  # Check user AWS configs

If you're concerned about breaking things, you can:


Create a duplicate role with restricted permissions
Test it on a duplicate instance first
Use AWS Config to track role changes over time:

bashCopyaws configservice get-resource-config-history \
    --resource-type AWS::IAM::Role \
    --resource-id YOUR-ROLE-NAME

Review Systems Manager Session Manager logs if enabled:

bashCopyaws ssm get-command-invocation \
    --command-id "YOUR-COMMAND-ID" \
    --instance-id "YOUR-INSTANCE-ID"
Remember:

Check logs over a long enough period (30-90 days) to catch periodic tasks
Look for patterns in time of day/week when certain permissions are used
Consider application deployment/update cycles that might need different permissions

Would you like me to expand on any of these approaches?






kay I want to know all actions performed by this ec2 instance using this role . I also want to know which ec2 instances are using this role


Perfect! Let's break this down into two parts:

To find all EC2 instances using this role:
bash

Copy
# List all EC2 instances with this role/instance profile
aws ec2 describe-instances \
    --filters "Name=iam-instance-profile.arn,Values=arn:aws:iam::*:instance-profile/YOUR-ROLE-NAME" \
    --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].[InstanceId,Tags[?Key==`Name`].Value|[0],State.Name,LaunchTime]' \
    --output table
To find all actions performed by your specific EC2 instance:
bash

Copy
# Get all CloudTrail events for your instance
aws cloudtrail lookup-events \
    --start-time "2024-02-13" \
    --lookup-attributes AttributeKey=Username,AttributeValue=YOUR-INSTANCE-ID \
    | jq '.Events[] | {
        eventTime: (.CloudTrailEvent | fromjson).eventTime,
        eventName: (.CloudTrailEvent | fromjson).eventName,
        eventSource: (.CloudTrailEvent | fromjson).eventSource,
        awsRegion: (.CloudTrailEvent | fromjson).awsRegion
    }' | jq -s 'group_by(.eventSource) | map({
        service: .[0].eventSource,
        actions: map(.eventName) | unique
    })'
If you want a more detailed analysis, this query will show you frequency of actions:

bash

Copy
aws cloudtrail lookup-events \
    --start-time "2024-02-13" \
    --lookup-attributes AttributeKey=Username,AttributeValue=YOUR-INSTANCE-ID \
    | jq '.Events[] | {
        eventSource: (.CloudTrailEvent | fromjson).eventSource,
        eventName: (.CloudTrailEvent | fromjson).eventName
    }' | jq -s 'group_by(.eventSource) | map({
        service: .[0].eventSource,
        actions: group_by(.eventName) | map({
            action: .[0].eventName,
            count: length
        })
    })'
This will give you:

All unique AWS services being accessed
All unique actions per service
How often each action is used
When the actions occurred
The output will look something like:

json

Copy
[
  {
    "service": "eks.amazonaws.com",
    "actions": [
      {
        "action": "DescribeCluster",
        "count": 150
      },
      {
        "action": "ListClusters",
        "count": 45
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "service": "s3.amazonaws.com",
    "actions": [
      {
        "action": "GetObject",
        "count": 200
      }
    ]
  }
]
This gives you everything you need to:

See which instances are using the role
See exactly what AWS actions are being performed
Understand the frequency of each action
Identify potentially unnecessary permissions
Would you like me to help you format this into a policy document that matches the actual usage?

T
so Is it possible to know only the actions performed by the ec2 instance when it assumes this role ?


Yes! When an EC2 instance assumes a role, it gets a specific session identifier in CloudTrail. Here's how to find exactly those actions:

bash

Copy
# Get actions by instance when assuming the specific role
aws cloudtrail lookup-events \
    | jq '.Events[] | select(
        (.CloudTrailEvent | fromjson).userIdentity.type == "AssumedRole" and
        (.CloudTrailEvent | fromjson).userIdentity.sessionContext.sessionIssuer.userName == "YOUR-ROLE-NAME" and
        (.CloudTrailEvent | fromjson).userIdentity.principalId | endswith("YOUR-INSTANCE-ID")
    )' | jq '{
        eventTime: (.CloudTrailEvent | fromjson).eventTime,
        eventName: (.CloudTrailEvent | fromjson).eventName,
        eventSource: (.CloudTrailEvent | fromjson).eventSource,
        userIdentity: (.CloudTrailEvent | fromjson).userIdentity
    }'
Or more specifically for just the actions grouped by service:

bash

Copy
aws cloudtrail lookup-events \
    | jq '.Events[] | select(
        (.CloudTrailEvent | fromjson).userIdentity.type == "AssumedRole" and
        (.CloudTrailEvent | fromjson).userIdentity.sessionContext.sessionIssuer.userName == "YOUR-ROLE-NAME" and
        (.CloudTrailEvent | fromjson).userIdentity.principalId | endswith("YOUR-INSTANCE-ID")
    )' | jq '{
        service: (.CloudTrailEvent | fromjson).eventSource,
        action: (.CloudTrailEvent | fromjson).eventName
    }' | jq -s 'group_by(.service) | map({
        service: .[0].service,
        actions: map(.action) | unique
    })'
The key parts in the filter are:

userIdentity.type == "AssumedRole" - confirms it's a role assumption
sessionContext.sessionIssuer.userName == "YOUR-ROLE-NAME" - matches your specific role
principalId | endswith("YOUR-INSTANCE-ID") - matches your specific instance
This will show you ONLY the actions performed by that specific EC2 instance when using that specific role, which is exactly what you need to right-size the permissions.

Would you like me to help you format this into a more readable output or show you how to turn these findings into a least-privilege policy?

T
and that will give me the output of the service acrtions?


Yes! The output will show you the exact service actions. Let me show you what the output looks like:

bash

Copy
# This command will show you service:action format
aws cloudtrail lookup-events \
    | jq '.Events[] | select(
        (.CloudTrailEvent | fromjson).userIdentity.type == "AssumedRole" and
        (.CloudTrailEvent | fromjson).userIdentity.sessionContext.sessionIssuer.userName == "YOUR-ROLE-NAME" and
        (.CloudTrailEvent | fromjson).userIdentity.principalId | endswith("YOUR-INSTANCE-ID")
    )' | jq '{
        service: (.CloudTrailEvent | fromjson).eventSource,
        action: (.CloudTrailEvent | fromjson).eventName
    }'
The output will look something like this:

json

Copy
{
  "service": "eks.amazonaws.com",
  "action": "DescribeCluster"
}
{
  "service": "eks.amazonaws.com",
  "action": "ListClusters"
}
{
  "service": "s3.amazonaws.com",
  "action": "GetObject"
}
These translate directly to IAM permissions:

eks.amazonaws.com + DescribeCluster = eks:DescribeCluster
eks.amazonaws.com + ListClusters = eks:ListClusters
s3.amazonaws.com + GetObject = s3:GetObject
So if your current policy has eks:*, but you only see DescribeCluster and ListClusters in the logs, you know you can tighten the policy to just those specific actions.

Would you like me to show you how to format this into a proper IAM policy document?
